# Introduction
This is my personal blog Jekyll setup and it also has the article file as well. It will be updated each time I write a new article and whenever I change the Jekyll setup.

**Note:** Jekyll setup means adding plugin, defining layout, theming etc.

# Installation
This will be added in the futre.
